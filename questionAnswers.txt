1. What are the key features of the application? Are these clearly separated into their own files, classes, and/or modules?
    The key features of this application is to generate a random understandable sentence from a text file.
    All of the files necessary for this application is stored in one repo. Each file in the repo is responsible for different task.
    Each file has classes and methods that can be used in other files as well


2. Are the names of files, modules, functions, and variables appropriate and accurate? Would a new programmer be able to understand the names without too much contextual knowledge?
    A new programmer might have some difficulty understanding the files at first, but the docstrings and comments will help give them a better guidance.


3. What are the scopes of variables and are they appropriate for their use case? If there are global variables, why are they needed?
    Most variable are local variable minus a select few including the histogram and the source text. These variables can be used in any file at any time.


4. Are the functions small and clearly specified, with as few side effects as possible?
    Every function is concise and only accomplishes one specific task to keep it dry


5. Are there functions that could be better organized in an Object-Oriented Programming style by defining them as methods of a class?
    No some functions are working independently, therefore having the function as a method in a class will not work. 


6. Can files be used as both modules and as scripts?
    Files may be used as a module however not all files are allowed to be used as a script.


7. Do modules all depend on each other or can they be used independently?
    Every module may used independently or used with other files
